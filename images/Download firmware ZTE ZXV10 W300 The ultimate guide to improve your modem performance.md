After updating the firmware, you may want to check if everything is working properly. Here are some tips to troubleshoot your router:

- Make sure the router's power and internet lights are on and stable. If they are blinking or off, there may be a problem with the power supply or the internet connection.
- Try to access the router's web interface again and see if you can login and change the settings. If you can't, you may need to reset the router to its factory defaults by pressing and holding the reset button for 10 seconds. This will erase all your custom settings and restore the default username and password.
- Test your internet speed and stability by visiting a website like [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/). If you notice a significant drop or fluctuation in your speed, you may need to adjust some settings on your router, such as the channel, bandwidth, or encryption mode.
- If you have any other devices connected to your router, such as computers, smartphones, or smart TVs, make sure they can connect to the internet and access the network resources. If they can't, you may need to reconnect them to the router or update their network settings.

If you still have any issues with your router after updating the firmware, you can contact ZTE customer support or visit their website for more information.

Updating your firmware is a good way to keep your router up to date and secure. However, you may not need to do it very often. Here are some reasons why you may want to update your firmware:

- There is a new feature or improvement that you want to use on your router.
- There is a security vulnerability or bug that needs to be fixed on your router.
- You are experiencing some issues or errors with your router that may be solved by updating the firmware.

On the other hand, there are some risks and drawbacks of updating your firmware. Here are some of them:

- You may lose some of your custom settings or preferences on your router.
- You may encounter some compatibility issues with your devices or applications that rely on your router.
